AFRI 0840,"Monuments, History, and Memory in the United States","In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, monuments tied to the violent histories of slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy have received renewed interest and debate. Protestors and individuals have defaced, toppled, and petitioned for the removal of Confederate monuments and statues to the white male power elite. This symbolic retributive violence and sometimes ritual care signals a challenge to the long-lived monument. This reading course explores public monuments and the ways in which artists and communities have negotiated history and the politics of memory and remembrance in the United States. We will evaluate the meaning and purpose of monuments that define American public spaces, investigating the problematic narratives and historic controversies surrounding such objects.

GNSS 1961R,Sex and Money: The History of Paris since 1750,"Paris, seen through the rose-tinted glasses of Hollywood, is the city of love. How did this come to be? And what does this image hide? Across the modern period, shopping and women’s work were sexualized, prostitution was normalized, regulated, and made “safe” for bourgeois clients, nude women performed on music hall stages, and gay cultures emerged in new commercial venues. This class will examine how sexual commerce shaped the identity of the city, how the commercial spaces of the city shaped sexual identities, and how discourses about sexuality contributed to the legitimation of capitalism. We will engage with topics ranging from the construction of gender difference and the emergence of mass media, to the relationship between the expansion of global capitalism and the rise of moral panics.",[],FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We will examine the relationship between finance and writing by looking at, among other things, the literary creation of three fictional boom towns: Kíllac, Macondo, and Tora. Through the invention of these places, literature in Latin America has sought to give sense to its ‘peripheral’ position within the capitalist world-system and challenged common-sense narratives about economic development, progress, and social structures. Students will thus learn about economic cycles and financial crises in Latin America from a cultural perspective.

We will be reading in the original language Aristophanes’ ""Ecclesiazusae"" (""Assemblywomen""). This late play of Aristophanes is the last of his three comedies on the topic of women, and is remarkable in representing women as taking complete control of the state and instituting a radical communism in property and family.

In this context, Koselleck proposed the idea of a history of past futures, in which facts are considered alongside past possibilities and their horizons. Taking up these thoughts on history and historical time, we will consider time and testimony in literary texts with a focus on the work of Ilse Aichinger.

The notion that art’s relationship to society is one of negation, diagnosis, and destabilization pervades modern art history. This seminar will trace the development of criticality as an artistic practice and art-historical methodology. Alongside texts on critique in philosophy and theory, we will examine artists for whom criticality is paramount: Dada’s ballistic mission, repetitions of the neo-avant-garde, anti-art, institutional critique, critical postmodernism, art as undercommons.

This class will study his artistic evolution: from his youth in Granada, and his studies in Madrid-where he met and befriended filmmaker Luis Buñuel and painter Salvador Dalí-to his trip to New York and Latin America. The focus of the class will be the study of his poetry, theatre, and essays, but will also explore both the construction of the Lorca myth, and the period of cultural splendor that is encapsulated in his biographical dates: from the loss of the empire in 1898, to the beginning of the Civil War in the summer of 1936.",[],FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This course aims at deciphering the complex interaction between infrastructure, society, politics, and human experience.

Plato treats god as a craftsman who looks to unchanging forms and attempts to replicate them in recalcitrant materials. By contrast, Aristotle regards the cosmos as eternal. His god maintains the world as the relatively stable place it is and does so as an object of desire and thought.

To that end, we will foster a collaborative dialogue about the diverse “temporalities” that inform our thinking about the earth and its history, from creation stories to the modern idea of progress.

We read classic and more recent scholarship on colonial wars and violence, the ideology of the French “civilizing mission”, legal and economic discrimination and how colonialism transformed local ecologies. Colonial power was constantly debated, resisted, and subverted across metropole and colonies. We pay close attention to these voices and trace the emergence of political anti-colonialism in the aftermath of the First World War.

BIOL 2350,The Biology of Aging,"Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of ""geroscience"" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases.

COLT 1422N,Peasant-Boom-Slum: The Latin American Novel,"Despite being associated with peasants and agricultural goods, Latin America has become the most urbanized region in the world. In this course, we will analyze novels that attempt to make sense of Latin American society in relation to this chaotic and rapid historical transformation. Beginning with nineteenth-century writers who called on civilization to conquer the barbaric countryside, we move to the so-called “Boom” novels of the twentieth century that ambiguously questioned the authoritarian and destructive impulses of this modernizing project, and conclude with contemporary authors who reflect on the utter collapse of modernization. In these novels, we will see that the topic of the city and the countryside becomes a powerful framework for imagining and thinking through issues of indigeneity, gender, industrialization, memory and dictatorship.
